A Maven ArcheType for Spout Server

The spout-archetype was created to help speed up the process of creating a plugin.

Developers please feel free to contribute to the archetype

What is an Archetype
--------------------
An archetype is basically a template used to help create maven applications. They include:

* Dependencies needed for basic operation (in this case spoutapi)
* Repositories are already filled in (repo.spout.org)
* POMs are already filled in with variables that are assigned when you select the archetype
* Files are already pre-named
* Files and File structures are already in place.
* Basic code to get you started is already done for you.

An archetype is not only for beginner coders, or people new to the project, it is designed to be used by even experienced coders, it does get tedious to always create the base code by hand.
